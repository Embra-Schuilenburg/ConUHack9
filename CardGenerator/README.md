# MtG Card Generator

## SLOP DISCLAIMER
This is meant to be absolute garbage.  

Ben (me) ran out of ideas so he used Trump quotes (accessible via https://whatdoestrumpthink.com/api-docs/index.html) to generate Magic the Gathering cards. 

**Use at your own risk. May produce NSFW / +18 results.**

Requires a couple python libraries, such as OpenAI (for text and image generation), PIL (image cropping), requests (to poke API), and some others sprinkled in.

Requires use of an OpenAI API Key. Refer to https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart#create-and-export-an-api-key

Blank card provided from https://www.mtgcardmaker.com/

I do plan to use another quotes API to prevent my slop from degrading further.
